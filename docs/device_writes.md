# Setting Pin and Device Values
In this section, we discuss writing data to:

* Digital pins.
* PWM pins.
* Piezo tone devices.
* Servo motors.
* Stepper Motors.

***NOTE:*** I2C devices are discussed in the next section of this guide. 

## digital_write
```python
 def digital_write(self, pin, value)

    Set the specified pin to the specified value.

    :param pin: arduino pin number

    :param value: pin value (1 or 0)

```
