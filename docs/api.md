# Categorizing The API Methods

To gain a better understanding of the API, let's divide the API into several categories, and then sort the methods
by category.

The group of API categories is as follows:

* Instantiation of the pymata4 class
* Establishing a pin mode.
* Monitoring pin state changes.
    * Callbacks
    * Polling
* Requesting Report Information
* Performing Management Functions
