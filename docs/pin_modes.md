# Introduction
Before using an Arduino pin, its mode must first be set. Let's look at how this is done.

# Pin Mode Type
In general, a pin may be set as an _input_ pin, _output_ pin or a _device-type_ pin.

Here is a list of method calls for each type and a link to an example of its use:

* Input Pin Modes
    * set_pin_mode_analog_input
    * set_pin_mode_digital_input
    * set_pin_mode_digital_input_pullup
